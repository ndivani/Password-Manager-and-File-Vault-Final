Passwords are stored in keychain, as is passcode to log in to app.
No functionality yet to change passcode, so to set passcode, hit the button at top of numpad on login screen, then restart the app. You should then be able to log in to app using 0000 as the passcode.

Note for those that haven't created a provisioning profile for their device, it should run in simulator, although I haven't tested this for the new login.

No storyboard for iPad has been created yet so not sure how it will look on iPad, but that being said, haven't implemented any design for this app, the UI is simply there to demonstrate some of the functionality the app has with the keychain. Looking for feedback on what it can do for the demo, and how it should operate. Can be the look and/or feel of the app, or what it should allow the user to do.
